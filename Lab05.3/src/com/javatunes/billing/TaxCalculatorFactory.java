     * If I have not previously created the object (e.g., USATax),
     * i.e., it's not in the cache, then I'll create it
     * here (with "new"), add it to my cache, and then return it.
     *
     * However, if my cache already contains it, then I just fetch it from the cache and
     * return it - no need to create another one.
     *
     * Hint: you could use a simple Map<Location,TaxCalculator> for the cache.
     * It would be a 3-row Map, each row has Location | TaxCalculator
